# notes-general
Notes for general use.

## Use
Open the `/notes` folder in Obsidian. Notes are written with Obsidian and are not optimized for GitHub. So the text might look janky and pictures might not load here. Install Obsidian from either from these:

* https://obsidian.md/download
* https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/
